# Fun with Google Static Maps and Firebase
This repo uses HTML5 geolocate to grab the user's Lat/Lang info. I then plug that into Google's Static Maps service to render a nice JPEG of the user location. 

Just for fun, I also use Firebase to create a UID for every site visitor. You also have the option to login using your Gmail credentials, using Firebase's Authentication services.
